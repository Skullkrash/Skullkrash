As a graduate from the Computer Science Bachelor's program at the IUT Robert Schuman in Illkirch-Graffenstaden, I am passionate about programming.

I am now studying as a 1st-year engineer in an IT and Information Systems at the CNAM in Strasbourg.

With experience at INCOTEC, I have a solid understanding of the corporate environment in the field of computer science.

Eager for continuous learning and opportunities, I am open to sharing and collaborating in the field of technology.
